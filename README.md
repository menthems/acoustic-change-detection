# Acoustic Change Detection

This repository contains code and experiments for my Master’s thesis project on **acoustic change detection** at Mines Paris-PSL.

The goal of this project is to explore methods for detecting changes in acoustic environments using machine learning models and audio processing pipelines. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation scripts, and experiment logs.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is research code, developed as part of an academic thesis. It is not production-ready and contains exploratory scripts, notebooks, and intermediate files.
